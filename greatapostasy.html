          <h2>After the death of Christ</h2>

          <br/>
          <p class= "great-d"> After the life, death, and resurrection of the Savior, His Church that He had established upon the earth was left under the leadership of His chosen apostles. These apostles carried his sacred authority known as the priesthood and through said authority, they were able to spread the gospel and establish the Church of Jesus Christ among the Gentiles. They received special communication from the resurrected Christ through revelation. </p>
          <br/>
          <h2>The First Church of Jesus Christ</h2>
          <br/>
          <p>As the Church of Jesus Christ began to grow, the apostles and other members began to be killed and persecuted by the Jews, Romans, etc. Needless to say that slowly all that carried the authority of Jesus Christ began to be killed one by one. Soon faithful apostles and disciples of Jesus Christ knew that with time the authority of Christ will be lost and His teachings corrupted and began to prophesy of a restoration of the gospel. In the bible we read:</p>
          <br/>
          <p><em>“ That in the dispensation of the fulness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ, both which are in heaven, and which are on earth; even in him: “ (Ephesians 1:10)</em></p>
          <br/>
          <p>Unfortunately, the authority of Christ was lost as the apostles died and the pure and simple teachings of Jesus Christ were lost. </p>
          <br/>
          <h2>The Great Apostasy</h2>
          <br/>
          <p>The Great Apostasy started when the authority of Jesus Christ was taken from the earth through the death of the apostles. As the apostles died, the Lord stopped appointing worthy men to fulfill that role. This period marked the beginning of an era of confusion and contention about the teachings that are found in the Bible. Over the course of hundreds of years, no one knew who to believe on the subject of religion and had spiraled out of control with the creation of hundreds of churches around the world all searching for the truth. And it wasn’t until the 1800s that the Lord had called a new prophet named Joseph Smith Jr. and through him, Christ restored His sacred authority and His Church</p>
