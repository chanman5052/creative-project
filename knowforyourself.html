              <b>Learn: </b>The message of the Restoration of the Gospel of Jesus Christ is a message that originates from Heavenly Father who can communicate that message with us in a variety of ways. Heavenly Father can teach us the truth through living prophets, scriptures such as the Book of Mormon and the Doctrine and Covenants, and through the missionaries. They can teach us the message of the Restoration but only we can ask for ourselves to know the truth.

              <b>Act: </b>: The last thing that God encourages us to do is to pray to know the truth. Once we have learned the truth, we are invited to act for ourselves and pray directly to Him and ask Him if it is true.

              <b>Pray: </b>The Book of Mormon promises every person that studies its content that if they act on their faith and ask God then “by the power of the Holy Ghost ye may know the truth of all things”(Moroni 10:5). Millions of members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints are comforted by the fact that their testimony is based on divine inspiration. As stated before that to pray and ask God like Joseph Smith did requires faith in God and His ability to answer prayers. You too can know if you take this last step and pray about this message.
