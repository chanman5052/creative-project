<div class="panel">
  <p>As seen in the section titled "The Great Apostasy", the series of events prior to the 19th Century created a 
    tumultuous environment concerning religion. Everyone had formulated their own opinions and interpretations regarding 
    the teachings taught in the scriptures. In the early 19th Century in Palmyra, New York, a young teenage boy named Joseph Smith
    had many questions regarding the different religions and which one of them taught the same gospel that Christ and His apostles
    taught.

<button class="accordion">Who is Joseph Smith?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>Many people may have heard a thing or two regarding the man, Joseph Smith. So who exactly was he and why is he so important?
    During the Second Great Awakening, Joseph Smith and his family lived on a small farm in Palmayra New York. The Second Great
    Awakening was a religious revival in the United States and in the area in which the Smith family lived it was normal for different
    preachers of different religions to pass through and teach in the area and many had established their own churches. Living in this 
    high traffic area of important religious figures, the teenage Jospeh Smith realized jut how confused hew was. In his own words he said:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <em>In the midst of this war of words and tumult of opinions, I often said to myself: What is to be done? Who of all these parties are right; or, are they all wrong together? If any one of them be aright, which is it, and how shall I know it?
       (Joseph Smith - History 1:10)
    </em>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It really is quite simple, if we are confused or have a question, we would go research and acquire as much knowledge as we can in order to find
    an answer or clarification. And Joseph Smith did exactly just that.

    The Protestant Reformation, specifically Martin Luther, introduced this idea that anyone interested in knowing the truth shouls at least learn some of that 
    truth for themselves by studying the scriptures. It was through this method that Martin Luther found so many discrepancies in Catholic doctrine 
    and was able to create the 95 theses. 
    <br/>
    In his quest for truth, Joseph Smith knew that he needed to study directly from the Bible if he was going to search for unbiased answers to his question. 
    While attending a sermon, he heard the preacher quote James 1:5-6. With that scripture in mind, Joseph Smith studied and pondered what the scripture said:
    <br>
    <br>
    <em> If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him.
      <br>
     But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering. For he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed. (James 1:5-6)</em>
    <br>
    <br>
    No such scripture had ever impacted him as much as this one. After searching with faith, Joseph was shown a way in which he could
    receive guidance from God. Joseph had never prayed vocally before and naturally was nervous, but he also trusted the promise that no matter
    what God would answer as long as he had faith.

    After determining a location where he would pray, Joseph Smith was ready to ask God his question about which church was His Church. He went to a secluded location
    in a grove near his home and knelt down to pray. During his life, Joseph Smith wrote about this prayer four times. Each account varies in detail, which will be further explained
    in the section titled "Why Four Visions?" The account that will be shared is included in his official historical account, Joseph Smith - History. When Joseph Smith prayed, is answer was described
    as follows: 
    <br>
    <br>
    <em>But, exerting all my powers to acall upon God to deliver me out of the power of this enemy which had seized upon me, and at the very moment when I was ready to sink into bdespair and abandon myself to destruction—not to an imaginary ruin, but to the power of some actual being from the unseen world, who had such marvelous power as I had never before felt in any being—just at this moment of great alarm, I saw a pillar of clight exactly over my head, above the brightness of the dsun, which descended gradually until it fell upon me. [...] When the light rested upon me I bsaw two cPersonages, whose brightness and dglory defy all description, estanding above me in the air. One of them spake unto me, calling me by name and said, pointing to the other—This is My fBeloved gSon. Hear Him!
      (Joseph Smith - History 1:16-17)
    </em>
    <br>
    <br>
    Joseph knew that this prayer was a special occasion`when both God and Jesus Christ appeared to him. When Joseph asked about which Church to join, they responded that he should join none of them, for they did not
    teach the true teachings of Jesus Christ. He was told to wait for a near future in which he would be called to restore the true gospel of Jesus Christ

  <p>
    Joseph Smith gave four accounts of his prayer to God. Each account varies in minor details but overall communicate the same message: that Joseph Smith prayed to God and had a vision of Him. 
    Similar to how whenever an individual tells the same story multiple times it will vary in detail depending on the context, purpose of the story, and the audience. For these same reasons are there minor
    variations in each account of The First Vision. They all communicate the same experience and were told depending on the situation and who Joseph Smith was communicating with.

<button class="accordion">The Restoration</button>
<div class= "panel">
  <p>
    As we learned earlier, the original Church of Jesus Christ and His simple and sacred teachings had been changed multiple times without any approval or divine authoriation until they beared no resemblance to how they were 
    originally. When he realized just how wicked the people of his and future generations were, the Apostle Paul prophesied of a Restoration of the Gospel of Christ: 
    <br>
    <br>
    <em>That in the dispensation of the fulness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ, both which are in heaven, and which are on earth; even in him
      (Ephesians 1:10)
    </em>
    <br>
    <br>
    The First Vision marked an era known as The Restoration. A period in which God restores the complete gospel of Jesus Christ and the Church of Jesus Christ. God
    introduced a new set of scriptures titled The Book Mormon whose sole purpose is to be another testimony of Jesus Christ along with the Bible.
    The Book of Mormon teaches the true nature of the doctrine of Christ such as baptism and the authority of Jesus Christ. A divine authority that was restored through angelic
    visitations. As time progressed, Heavenly Father gradually revealed eternal truths to the prophet Joseph Smith. In April of 1830 the true church was restored
    known as The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints.
