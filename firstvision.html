          <h2>Joseph Smith's Question</h2>
          <br/>
          <p>In the year 1820, a young farm boy by the name of Joseph Smith Jr. was also confused by all of the different churches where he lived. At this time the United States had undergone a second religious revival called The Second Great Awakening which left many people conflicted from the different teachings taught by all of the different churches. Young Joseph pondered how so many religions could preach so many different ideas from the same source, The Bible. Not only did he want to know which church was true but wanted to ensure that his soul could be saved by the answer. As he studied the scriptures he came across a scripture in the Bible which stated</p>
          <br/>
          <p><em>If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him. (James 1: 5-6)</em></p>
          <br/>
          <h2>The First Vison</h2>
          <br/>
          <p>Joseph Smith knew that God could answer prayers, and so he went and prayed in a grove near his home. As he prayed, he had the following experience:</p>
          <br/>
          <p><em>I saw two Personages, whose brightness and glory defy all description, standing above me in the air. One of them spake unto me, calling me by name and said, pointing to the otherâ€”This is My Beloved Son. Hear Him! (JS-History, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints)</em></p>
          <br/>
          <p>The Lord told Joseph that all the churches taught corrupted teachings and to stay away from them and also explained that he would be an important part of the restoration of His true Church.</p>
          <br/>
          <h2>The Modern-Day Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints</h2>
          <br/>
          <p>Joseph was called to be a prophet of God and later in 1830 restored His Church through the prophet and called it The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. The Lord has brought forth The Book of Mormon: Another Testament of Jesus Christ. A set of scriptures that Joseph Smith translated by the power of God. </p>
